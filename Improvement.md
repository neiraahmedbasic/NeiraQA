Improvement Suggestion
Current Behavior:

When entering the site, a message appears warning that continuing will result in being logged out. After that, when attempting to view offers, users must scroll down to see the product categories.

Request:

Remove the confusing logout message when navigating to the main version of the site, or rephrase it to make it clearer. Additionally, ensure that product categories are immediately visible without the need to scroll – this could be achieved by placing them higher on the landing page or using a sticky category navigation bar.

Reason:

This would reduce user confusion and improve navigation efficiency, especially for first-time visitors. Making categories more accessible would help users find what they’re looking for faster, likely increasing engagement and conversion rates.

User Experience Feedback
Using the product listing page was generally clear, but not entirely intuitive. The design is modern and the color scheme is visually pleasant, but the layout of elements isn't always user-friendly. For example, product categories are not visible right away – I have to scroll to access them, which makes quick navigation more difficult. Additionally, the message about switching to another part of the site (secure version) is confusing and could discourage users.

Functions such as filters and sorting are useful and easy to use, but I would suggest adding an option to expand or collapse all filters to make the page more organized. Overall, the user flow could be simplified – currently there seem to be too many steps before the user reaches actual offers.

Ease of Use – Product Listing Page
Browsing through the product listing page was mostly understandable, but there is room for improvement. The colors and background are quite neutral, which makes the products blend in too much – adding more contrast or outlining product cards would help them stand out visually. Also, when I continued browsing the site, a message popped up saying I would be logged out, and instead of staying on the same page, I was redirected to the homepage – this disrupted the user journey.

The filter and sort features are functional and simple to use, but it would be helpful if filters were more visually prominent.

Single Product Page Feedback
On the individual product page, the available features are useful – I can view all product information, enlarge the image, share the product, and choose installment payments. However, the promotional banner for a regional newsletter takes up a lot of space and is quite distracting. It would be better if it were less intrusive.

The product view itself is well-designed and clear – I wouldn’t change anything there.

When it comes to design, the colors are pleasing, but the overall site appearance is too neutral – more contrast would help products stand out better. The font is readable, but the layout doesn’t guide the user clearly through the buying process. While the functionality is easy to use, especially filters and sorting, they aren’t visually emphasized enough.

I didn’t understand the need for the logout message when switching to the main version of the site – it creates a sense of uncertainty. I would also suggest adding a fixed menu with categories that remains visible while scrolling. Finally, the path from selecting a category to viewing specific products could be shortened, as the current number of steps may discourage users.
